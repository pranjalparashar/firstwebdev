  <p1><em>A <strong>First year BITSG</strong> undergrad.</em></p1>
  <p2>Hello! I welcome you to my first website.I have currently finished my first year and am learning some skills which
    would hopefully get me to a point where I can start contributing to some open source projects. I wish to learn ML and
    web dev during these vacations. I know I am a lot behind but I intend to work super hard and this basic HTML page is the
    first step towards that progress!</p2>
